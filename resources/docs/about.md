# About "Agile Sliders"

This is an application built to solve the problem of running "sliders" sessions to determine priorities. If you are unsure what these sessions are, please explore them as they can be very useful to your project. A synopsis is [also included below](#what-is-sliders-session).

 ### How this application helps
 
 With this application, you can create a custom sliders session to share with your colleagues with just a few clicks, including as many or as few priorities as you want in the session.
 
 They can then all load the link you send them and put in their opinions about the priority using a nice user interface which allows them to easily move some things up in priority, and know which other sliders they must then move down to reach equal priority. 
 
 When they are all done, a facilitator can then load a page which includes everyones responses including a total average for each slider. Discussion can happen at this point, and the sliders can be moved and equalized until everyone feels comfortable with the results.
 
 When complete, the session can be saved and the output can be used for the duration of the project.

### What is a sliders prioritization session?

These sessions are extremely useful in projects to determine priority of what a team is doing. For instance, if your team is trying to built software that is highly factored and reusable, accessible, and has a modern design, you might have the following priorities:

1. Highly factored
2. Accessibility
3. Modern Design
4. Finishing within budget
5. Deploying by a certain deadline

There are many decisions the team will have to make that will be affected by those priorities, so a session to determine which are the most important can be critical.

For instance, if you invite all important stakeholders to this session and determine that #5 is the most important priority, you may find that when the team is deciding to prioritize some refactoring, or a design task, that this puts at risk the project deadline.

If the team has had a sliders session and determined their priorities, they will know to deprioritize these tasks and focus on getting the deployment ready before playing those stories.

Conversely, in the same situation, if modern design is the highest priority because the application has promised a well developed design to the customers, and the #5 deadline priority is actually 3'rd in the list, the team may decide to prioritize some design tasks even if they put the deadline at risk because this is more important in the grand scheme of things.

### How is a sliders session usually run?

These sessions are often run by writing down priorities on sticky notes, placing on a whiteboard along multiple lines (one line for each priority) and in the center of each line. This suggests they start with identical priorities.

Someone will then suggest to move, for instance, a priority higher, and the team will discuss which other item should reduce in priority. At the end you should have all of the main components of your project in priority order.

You may end up with something as follows

### Problems with our current sliders sessions

These sessions can often be challenging to run for several reasons.
 
1. First and foremost, there is not a good way to run these sessions remotely. This was the impetus of this project.
 
2. They revolve around one person, who facilitates the session, moving the sliders. This can often give that person an advantage in having an impact on the session.

3. There is no good way to allow anonymous interaction in these sessions.
